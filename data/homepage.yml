  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    I am a passionated, eager to learn and self taught iOS Developer with a very wide range of different skills across multiple segments,
    such as in Engineering, videography and electronics with both hardware and software knowledge.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    This interest in different fields started at a very young age,
    when I was just 5 years old I got my very first dirt bike and with it my interest in mechanical engineering.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    This actually kickstarted my career as a car mechanic at the Audi dealer (for 11 years),
    eventually I felt like I could learn more and pursue my interest in electronics, so I decided to make a career switch.
    To do so I started studying at HAN University of Applied Sciences.
    During my studies I stumbled on the job as electronical prototype developer at Autodidact which I am working for over 4,5 years now.
    Also around the same period I started my own YouTube channel where I modify (mostly the interior of) my car.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    I started my iOS journey back in 2018, while I was still working at Autodidact.
    Because they wanted to create an iOS app for the EuroTech Center (Automotive) Helpdesk (which is a different department of Autodidact itself).
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    At the same time I was looking for a graduation assignment for the Bachelor Automotive Engineering.
    So we decided to combine the two and as result I created the iOS app: ETCA "EuroTech Center App",
    which combines automotive engineering and iOS Development.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    I received an 9 for this graduation assignment and graduated with honors!
    I really learned a lot creating ETCA and immediately fell in love with iOS Development.
    When SwiftUI came out I immediately started practicing with this new declarative user interface toolkit.
    Which resulted in my two latest created apps Mi Shopping List & eXandOs.
