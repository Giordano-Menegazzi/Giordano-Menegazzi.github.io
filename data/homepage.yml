  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    I am a passionated, eager to learn and self taught iOS Developer with a very wide range of different skills across multiple segments,
    such as in Engineering, videography, science and electronics with both hardware and software knowledge.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    This interest in different fields started at a very young age,
